# velocity model used to generate hypocenter, hyposat and TauP
# models
#
# the format is:
# depth,velp,vels,special-identifier
#
# depths and velocities are in km and km / second
#
# the special identifier can be used to denote one of:
#
# MOHO:     moho discontinuity
# surface:  surface
# seafloor: seafloor when applicable

# blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored
